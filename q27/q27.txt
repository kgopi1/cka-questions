Create a pod called web-pod using image nginx, expose it internally with a service called web-pod-svc.
 Check that you are able to lookup the service as well as pod from within the cluster.
  use Image busybox:1.28 for  a new nslookup pod to cross verify and record results in web-svc.svc and web-pod.pod
